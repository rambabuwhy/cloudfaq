## **Docker layers**

In Docker, a **Docker image** and **Docker layers** are two fundamental concepts that are closely related but serve different purposes.

#### Docker Image

A Docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container. It includes everything needed to run an application: the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Docker images are built in layers, and each image can be based on another image, adding its own customizations on top of the base image.

#### Docker Layers

Docker layers are the building blocks of a Docker image. Each layer represents a set of filesystem changes or instructions in the image's Dockerfile. When a Docker image is created, it starts with a base layer (often an official image like `alpine`, `ubuntu`, or `node`), and each subsequent command in the Dockerfile adds a new layer on top of the previous ones.

**How Layers Work:**

* **Layering Process:** When you build a Docker image using a Dockerfile, each instruction (such as `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`) creates a new layer.
* **Caching:** Docker caches each layer, which makes subsequent builds faster because Docker can reuse layers that have not changed.
* **Efficiency:** Layers allow Docker to optimize storage and build times. For instance, if you have an image with several layers and you change just one instruction, only that layer and the layers above it need to be rebuilt.

**Example:**

Consider the following Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
dockerfileCopy codeFROM ubuntu:20.04     # Layer 1: Base image
RUN apt-get update    # Layer 2: Update package lists
RUN apt-get install -y python3 # Layer 3: Install Python
COPY . /app           # Layer 4: Copy application code
CMD ["python3", "/app/app.py"] # Layer 5: Set the default command
```

* **Layer 1:** The base image (ubuntu:20.04).
* **Layer 2:** Runs `apt-get update` (this layer updates the package lists).
* **Layer 3:** Installs Python (this layer installs Python on top of the updated package lists).
* **Layer 4:** Copies application code from the host to the container.
* **Layer 5:** Specifies the default command to run the application.

Each of these instructions creates a new layer. When Docker builds the image, it caches each layer. If you change the application code and rebuild the image, Docker only rebuilds the `COPY` and `CMD` layers if the earlier layers haven't changed.

#### Summary:

* A **Docker image** is a complete, read-only template used to create Docker containers. It consists of a series of layers.
* **Docker layers** are the individual components or steps in a Dockerfile that form the image. Each layer is a delta of filesystem changes from the previous layer.
* The layering approach makes Docker images efficient by enabling reuse and caching of layers.
